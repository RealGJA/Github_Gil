Bitcoin is by most accounts the most widely accepted alternative currency having a monetary base in excess of $1 billion (USD) and is accepted by merchants, including service providers, throughout the world. Bitcoin is managed unlike most typical currencies and such that the need for a central bank is eliminated. Instead, as referenced above, Bitcoin is managed via an internet-based peer-to-peer network. \\\\n     It would be advantageous, to develop a standalone device capable of facilitating the purchase and sale of Bitcoin. Such a device should not require the use of any central monetary authority. \\\\n     SUMMARY \\\\n     Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention comprises a standalone Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device including at least the following components: (i) a bill validator; (ii) bill dispenser; (iii) printer; (iv) code scanner; (v) touch screen display; (vi) computing power in the form of a processor/controller; and (vii) internet connection means. The standalone device may include other components such as a backup power supply. The computing power may be local or remote as part of a Bitcoin kiosk/ATM network. A plurality of devices and central computer/server may form a network of devices. \\\\n     In practice, the standalone device facilitates the purchase of Bitcoin by: (i) permitting a user to deposit traditional currency (e.g., United States dollars); (ii) reading a code related to a digital account for receiving the purchased Bitcoin; (ii) confirming that the standalone device has sufficient Bitcoin to fund the purchase; (iv) generating and printing a receipt of the transaction. If the standalone device does not have sufficient funds to complete the transaction, the standalone device may acquire the necessary Bitcoin from the spot market by connecting to a Bitcoin exchange such as Bitstamp (www.bitstamp.net). \\\\n     In practice, the standalone device facilitates the sale of Bitcoin via two stages. A first stage comprises: (i) accepting an amount of desired traditional currency (e.g., United States dollars) as entered by the user; (ii) creating a transaction in a database; (iii) prompting the user to transmit the user&#39;s Bitcoin to a digital address assigned to the standalone device; and (iv) generating and printing a redemption receipt. A second stage comprises a user redeeming the redemption receipt during which: (i) the redemption receipt is electronically read; (ii) a comparison of the redemption receipt to the transaction in the database is conducted; (iii) a network confirmation of the user&#39;s Bitcoin is conducted; (iv) a confirmation that the redemption receipt has not been redeemed is conducted; and (v) cash is dispensed from the standalone device. \\\\n     Some of the steps required to buy and sell the Bitcoin may also be accomplished via a remote device such as a computer or smart phone which interacts with the standalone device. \\\\n     An enrollment and security protocol generally involves (i) a customer/user entering a mobile phone number into the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device; (ii) a SMS or text message including a random code being sent to the mobile phone; (iii) the user entering the code into the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device; (iv) the user entering and confirming a PIN; (v) the user providing a palm vein pattern; (vi) the user posing for a photo; and (vii) the user scanning their driver&#39;s license or passport. \\\\n     Other variations, embodiments and features of the present invention will become evident from the following detailed description, drawings and claims. \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n     \\\\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\\\n         FIG. 1  illustrates a block diagram of a Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device according to the embodiments of the present invention; \\\\n         FIG. 2  illustrates a block diagram of a Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device with access via remote devices according to the embodiments of the present invention; \\\\n         FIG. 3  illustrates a flow chart detailing an exemplary methodology followed by the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM according to the embodiments of the present invention; \\\\n         FIGS. 4   a - 4   h  illustrates a series of exemplary screen shots of a user interface associated with the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM according to the embodiments of the present invention; \\\\n         FIG. 5  illustrates an exemplary kiosk/ATM device design of the type which may be used to facilitate the embodiments of the present invention; \\\\n         FIG. 6  illustrates a network of kiosk/ATM devices according to the embodiments of the present invention; \\\\n         FIG. 7  illustrates a block diagram of a Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device with security enhancements according to the embodiments of the present invention; \\\\n         FIG. 8  illustrates a flow chart of a first enrollment and security protocol associated with the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device according to the embodiments of the present invention; \\\\n         FIGS. 9   a - 9   i  illustrate several screen shots commensurate with the flow chart of  FIG. 8  according to the embodiments of the present invention; and \\\\n         FIGS. 10   a - 10   c  show an exemplary Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device according to the embodiments of the present invention. \\\\n     \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION \\\\n     For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles in accordance with the embodiments of the present invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same.

At  320 , it is determined if the user has made the selection. If, at  320 , no selection is made in a pre-established time frame, the chart  300  loops back to  320 . Once a selection is made at  320 , at  325 , a destination Bitcoin address is entered by the user. The destination Bitcoin address is a digital address which is configured to receive the Bitcoin when electronically dispensed by the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device  100 . In one embodiment, the user enters the destination Bitcoin address by manually entering the same via the touch screen display  150 . In another embodiment, the code reader/scanner  140  reads a QR code, barcode or the like representing the destination Bitcoin address and which is depicted on the user&#39;s smart phone or similar electronic device. At  330 , it is determined whether a destination Bitcoin address has been entered, not entered or entered improperly. If no Bitcoin address has been entered, the chart  300  loops back to  330 . If an invalid code is entered at  330 , at  335 , a corresponding error message is created and the chart  300  loops back to  330  where the error message is displayed on the touch screen display  150 . If a valid code is received at  330 , at  340 , receipt information is generated and displayed for the user to review. At  345 , it is determined if the user has confirmed the receipt details via the touch screen display  150 . \\\\n     Upon confirmation of the receipt by the user, at  350 , a transaction is created and stored in a corresponding database. At  355 , a buy receipt is created. At  360 , the user inserts cash/notes into the bill validator  110  of the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM  100 . At  365 , it is determined whether the cash deposit is too little, too much or accurate. If too much, at  370 , the extra notes are rejected by the bill validator  110 . If too little, the chart  300  loops back to  360  for the user to deposit additional notes. If the transaction is aborted by the user or Bitcoin kiosk/ATM  100 , at  375 , all notes are rejected and, at  380 , the transaction is aborted. \\\\n     If, at  365 , the cash deposit is accurate, at  385 , it is determined if the Bitcoin is available from the inventory managed by the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device  100 . If so, at  390 , the Bitcoin transaction is completed such that, at  395 , the Bitcoin is transmitted from the local digital address associated with the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device  100  to the destination Bitcoin address provided previously by the user. Finally, at  400 , a Bitcoin sent message is presented to the user via the touch screen display  150 . Optionally, the Bitcoin sent message may also be transmitted to the user&#39;s smart phone or other mobile device. If, at  385 , it is determined that the Bitcoin is not available in the inventory, at  405 , the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM contacts, via wireless/wired internet connection means  170 , an online Bitcoin exchange, such as Bitstamp (www.bitstamp.net), to determine if the Bitcoin is available. If so, at  410 , the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device  100  purchases the necessary Bitcoin from the exchange to complete the transaction. If, at  405 , the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device  100  determines that the Bitcoin exchange does not have the necessary Bitcoin available, at  415 , a corresponding error message is presented to the user on the touch screen display  150 . \\\\n     If, at  310 , it is determined that the transaction type is a sale of Bitcoin, at  420 , the user selects an amount of Bitcoin or equivalent dollars to sell for cash. At  425 , it is determined if the user has made the selection. If, at  425 , no selection is made within a pre-established time period, the chart  300  loops back to  420 . If, at  425 , a selection is made, at  430 , a transaction is created and stored in a corresponding database. At  435 , a redemption receipt/coupon is generated and printed by printer  130 . Printing the redemption receipt/coupon allows Bitcoin sale processing to occur. At  440 , the user enters a Bitcoin address from which the Bitcoin to be sold is currently held. \\\\n     At  450 , the redemption receipt/coupon is redeemed via the code reader/scanner  140  such that the transaction ID created at  430  is collected and checked. At  455 , it is determined if the transaction ID is valid. If not, at  460 , a corresponding error message is presented to the user via the touch screen display  150 . If, at  455 , the transaction ID is validated, at  465 , the receipt type is determined. At  470 , a buy receipt determination at  465  results in receipt information being generated. If the receipt type is a buy, nothing happens because the buy has been, or should have already been, executed. The kiosk/ATM  100  will merely show a summary of the transaction. If, at  465 , a sell receipt is identified a new workflow process is implemented because after a user sends Bitcoin to the kiosk/ATM  100 , the Bitcoin network needs to process it. At  475 , the amount of Bitcoin from the receipt and the subject transaction record are compared. If the Bitcoin amounts do not match, at  480 , it is determined if the transaction has already been terminated. If so, at  485 , a receipt is generated. If, at  480 , it is determined that the transaction has not yet been aborted at  490 , the transaction is aborted and, at  495 , any withdrawn Bitcoin is refunded. \\\\n     If, at  475 , it is determined that the Bitcoin amounts do match, at  500 , receipt information is evaluated and, at  505 , it is determined if the transaction verification is complete. If not, the chart  300  loops back to  500 . If, at  505 , it is determined that the transaction verification is complete, at  510 , it is determined if the transaction verification occurred within 5 minutes. If not, the flow chart  300  advances to  490 . If a user does not send Bitcoin to the address provided by the kiosk/ATM  100  within the time period (e.g., 5 minutes), the order is deemed invalid. This is to mitigate market exchange rate fluctuations. If a user wishes to sell Bitcoin after the time period, a new transaction will need to be generated. If, at  510 , it is determined that the transaction verification occurred within five minutes, at  515 , the Bitcoin amount being offered for sale is verified by network confirmations. In one embodiment, one to six network confirmations (an industry standard) are deemed adequate to verify a suitable amount of Bitcoin held/owned by the seller. The well-established peer-to-peer Bitcoin network confirms transactions by recording the transactions in the transaction log or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblockchain\\xe2\\x80\\x9d stored across the peer-to-peer network every 10-minutes. After six confirmed records or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblocks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which may take up to an hour, a transaction is usually considered confirmed beyond reasonable doubt. If a user scans his sell receipt before the Bitcoin network has finished processing it, nothing happens and the user has to wait until it is ready. If, at  515 , it is determined that network confirmation has not occurred, at  520 , the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM  100  device waits for confirmation and goes inactive. If, at  515 , it is determined that network confirmation has occurred, at  525 , the user is prompted to depress a withdraw button or icon on the touch screen display  150 . At  530 , it is determined if there is sufficient cash in the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device  100  to fund the cash withdraw. If not, at  535 , the withdrawal is rejected for lack of available funds. If, at  530 , it is determined that there are sufficient funds available, at  540 , the user is prompted to confirm the withdrawal. If confirmation occurs, at  545 , the transaction is finished and, at  550 , the cash/notes are dispensed. \\\\n       FIGS. 4   a - 4   h  show a series of exemplary screen shots of the type which can be presented to the user via the touch screen display  150 .

At  810 , a customer enters a mobile phone number into the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device  700  via the touch screen display  730  or other interface. At  815 , the system generates and transmits to the customer&#39;s mobile phone a SMS or text message including a random code. At  820 , the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device  700  then prompts the customer to enter the code in the text message. At  825 , it is determined if the entered code matches the code sent as part of the text message. If not, at  830 , an error message is generated and, at  835 , the customer is prompted to enter the code again. If, at  840 , it is again determined that the code entered a second time does not match, at  845 , the session is terminated. Alternatively, the customer may be prompted to accept sending of a second text and code. If, at  825  or  840 , the entered code matches the code in the text message, at  850 , the customer is prompted to enter and confirm a PIN (e.g., 4 digit #). At  855 , the customer is prompted to provide a palm vein pattern via the biometric interface  745 . At  860 , the customer is prompted to pose for a photo using the camera/web cam  755 . At  865 , the customer is promoted to scan their driver&#39;s license or passport using the magnetic card reader  750  or reader/scanner  725 , respectively. As described, the enrollment process collects three pieces of information including: (i) what the customer knows (i.e., PIN); (ii) what the customer possess (i.e., mobile phone) and (iii) who the customer is (i.e., palm vein pattern). \\\\n     All of the information collected during the enrollment process, including the PIN, palm vein pattern, photo and scanned ID are stored into a user file for later retrieval as needed such as a future visit to the Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device  700 . In one embodiment, the live photo is compared to the photo on the scanned ID to determine a match. A lack of a match between the live photo and the photo on the scanned ID results in termination of the enrollment and a prompt to enroll at a live location. \\\\n       FIGS. 9   a - 9   i  show several screen shots commensurate with the flow chart of  FIG. 8  according to the embodiments of the present invention.

Field of the Invention \\\\n     This invention relates to a computer system and method for transacting bitcoin. \\\\n     2). Discussion of Related Art \\\\n     The Bitcoin network is a peer-to-peer payment system having a plurality of nodes that are connected to one another. Bitcoin exchange computer systems allow for users to exchange local currency into or out of bitcoin. Users send payments by broadcasting digitally signed messages to the Bitcoin network. Users may, for example, send and receive payments using mobile applications on mobile devices, client software or a web browser. \\\\n     Transactions do not explicitly identify the payor and payee by name or wallet. Instead, a bitcoin transaction transfers ownership to a new address, referred to as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBitcoin address\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The Bitcoin address is derived from the public portion of one or more cryptographic key pairs. The private portion of a key pair is not disclosed to the public. To send bitcoin sent to an address, a user broadcasts a payment message that is digitally signed with the associated private key. \\\\n     Participants known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cminers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at miner computer systems verify and timestamp transactions into a shared public database called a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblock chain\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The miners are rewarded with transaction fees and newly minted bitcoin for their effort. The miner computer systems are specialized computers that append blocks of transactions to the block chain. Solving a cryptographic puzzle required to append a block carries a reward plus fees included in transactions in the block. \\\\n     Host computer systems reside at various nodes and may host accounts or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwallets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that allow users to make and accept payments using bitcoin. The wallet stores the public key of the Bitcoin address and its associated private key. \\\\n     The transfer of bitcoin may be an onerous task if the entire public key of the Bitcoin address has to be copied and transmitted. \\\\n     When a transaction is made between two wallets at the same or different host computer systems, the transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network for block chain verification. Such a block chain verification may take a long time to complete. Miner fees are also associated with such a transfer and have to be paid by a host computer system requesting the transfer. \\\\n     It may be a security concern for users that their Bitcoin addresses may be stolen from their wallets. Existing systems do not provide a solution for maintaining security of Bitcoin addresses while still allowing the users to use Bitcoin addresses within their wallets for transacting with other users. \\\\n     A merchant computer system often has an online store and a website. A customer at a customer computer system may use a browser to access the online store via the website. Items are displayed for purchase in a local currency. Exchange rate between bitcoin and local currency changes over short periods of time. The price in local currency may thus change between the time that the local currency is displayed to the customer and the time that the customer decides to make the purchase. As a result, the customer or the merchant may incur a loss in local currency. The customer or merchant may then be reluctant to purchase using bitcoin. \\\\n     In order for a user to access their wallet, the user may log into their account through the website using a user name and password. If the user name and password become compromised then it may be possible for bitcoin to be stolen out of the wallet. Users may therefore be reluctant to store bitcoin in their wallets without any additional security features. \\\\n     Bitcoin transacting requires the use of a public key and a private key. The private key is used to sign an authorization and the public key is used to verify the signature. Some users may require control over their private keys in order to ensure to such users that bitcoin transacting will not take place without their express authorization. \\\\n     Content creators often put a lot of time and energy into their blog posts. These efforts are rarely rewarded because efficient technology does not exist for rewarding bloggers for their efforts. \\\\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\\\n     The invention provides a host computer system for transacting bitcoin including a processor, a network interface device connected to the processor, a computer readable medium connected to the processor, a data store on the computer readable medium and a set of instructions on the computer readable medium that are executable by the processor.

The first host computer system  14  is connected to the host node  30 . The bitcoin exchange computer system  26  is connected to the remote node  32 A. The second host computer system  16  is connected to the remote node  32 B. The miner computer system  28  is connected to the remote node  32 D or could reside on the same computer system. \\\\n     The first host computer system  14  is used primarily for transacting bitcoin and, as shown in  FIG. 1B , includes a website  34  having a user interface  36 , a login module  38 , a wallet establishment module  40 , a plurality of wallets  42 , a wallet management module  44  and a hosted email module  46 . The login module  38  is connected to the website  34  and the hosted email module  46  is connected to the login module  38 . The wallet establishment module  40  is connected to the wallets  42 . The hosted email module  46  is connected via the wallet management module  44  to the wallets  42 . As illustrated in the drawing, the first user device  18  is connected over the Internet  22  and the user interface  36  to the login module  38 . As further illustrated in the drawing, the hosted email module  46  is connected over the Internet  22  to the second user device  20  and the second user device  20  is connected over the Internet  22  and the user interface  36  to the wallet establishment module  40 . \\\\n     As shown in  FIG. 2 , the first host computer system  14  already has one wallet (Wallet A) stored among the wallets  42  corresponding to the first user device  18 . The first wallet (Wallet A) includes an email address (email address A) and login details for the wallet. The first wallet (Wallet A) also includes a number of Bitcoin addresses (Bitcoin address  1 ; Bitcoin address  2 ) that have been created due to respective transfers or purchases (Transfer  1 ; Transfer  2 ). The first Bitcoin address (Bitcoin address  1 ) is created due to a purchase (Transfer  1 ) from a master wallet of the first host computer system  14  (First Host) and is recorded for a value in an amount in bitcoin. The second Bitcoin address (Bitcoin address  2 ) is created due to a transfer (Transfer  2 ) from another location within the Bitcoin network  12  having a network address outside of the first host computer system  14  and is recorded for a particular amount in bitcoin. The first wallet (Wallet A) was originally established by the wallet establishment module  40  in  FIG. 1B . The email address (email address A) and login details of the first wallet were also recorded by the wallet establishment module  40 . The wallet establishment module  40  and wallet management module  44  were used to record the transfers and purchases (Transfer  1 ; Transfer  2 ), their Bitcoin addresses (Bitcoin address  1 ; Bitcoin address  2 ), their values and other details within the wallet. \\\\n     A user of the first user device  18  in  FIG. 1B  may use a mobile application on the first user device  18  to communicate over the Internet  22  directly with the login module  38  or may use a browser on the first user device  18  to communicate via the Internet  22  and the website  34  with the login module  38 . A browser application on the first user device  18  transmits a user interface request over the Internet  22  to the website  34 . The website  34  responds to the user interface request by transmitting the user interface  36  over the Internet  22  to the first user device  18 . The user interface  36  is then displayed on the first user device  18 . The user interface  36  includes fields for entering login credentials, which are then transmitted from the first user device  18  over the Internet  22  to the login module  38 . The login module  38  verifies whether the login credentials match the login details for the wallet (Wallet A). If the login credentials match the login details, then the login module  38  logs the first user device  18  into the wallet (Wallet A) in  FIG. 2 . If the login credentials do not match the login details, then the first user device  18  is not logged in to the wallet. \\\\n     If the first user device  18  in  FIG. 1B  is logged in to the wallet, the login module  38  also provides access for the first user device  18  to the hosted email module  46  and transmission of an email by a user of the first user device  18  to an email address of the second user device  20 . The user interface  36  provides a field for entering the email address of the second user device  20 . The user interface  36  also includes a field for entering an amount in bitcoin (or an amount in local currency that is converted to bitcoin using an exchange rate) that is being transferred from the wallet (Wallet A) corresponding to the first user device  18  to a respective wallet among the wallets  42  corresponding to the second user device  20  that has not yet been established at this point in time. The user of the first user device  18  then uses the hosted email module  46  to send an email at  50  to the second user device  20 . The hosted email module  46  simultaneously at  52  instructs the wallet establishment module  40  to establish a wallet corresponding to the email address within the wallets  42 . The hosted email module  46  simultaneously instructs the wallet management module  44  to record the amount of bitcoin that is being transferred from the wallet (Wallet A) within the wallet corresponding to the email address. \\\\n       FIG. 3  illustrates further activity within the wallets  42  due to the email represented by a third transfer (Transfer  3 ). When the user of the first wallet (Wallet A) transmits the email, the system uses an existing Bitcoin address (Bitcoin address  2 ) to which the outgoing transfer is charged. Associated with the transfer (Transfer  3 ) are the email address to which the email has been transmitted, the amount in bitcoin, a miner&#39;s fee of zero bitcoin that is paid by the first host computer system  14  to any miner computer system such as the miner computer system  28  in  FIG. 1A , and a host fee of zero bitcoin that are charged to the wallet (Wallet A) for the transfer. A second wallet (Wallet B) is established by the wallet establishment module  40  and the email address (email address B) of the second user device  20  is recorded as an identifier of the wallet (Wallet B). A Bitcoin address (Bitcoin address  3 ) is recorded within the second wallet (Wallet B) for the transfer (Transfer  3 ). Within the second wallet (Wallet B), the transfer (Transfer  3 ) has the Bitcoin address (Bitcoin address  3 ), the identifier of the wallet (Wallet A) from where the funds are transferred associated therewith, and the amount in bitcoin that has been transferred. The amount in bitcoin corresponding to the transfer (Transfer  3 ) of both wallets (Wallet A; Wallet B) is the same, consistent with double entry accounting principles. The second wallet (Wallet B) so far has no login details or any other user information and has not been accessed by a user of the second user device  20  at this point in time. \\\\n       FIG. 4  illustrates the email when it is received at the second user device  20  in  FIG. 1B . The email is received and viewed within an email application on the second user device  20 . The email includes a link (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cClick here to sign in and claim this amount\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) that, when selected by the user of the second user device  20 , transmits a user interface request from the browser on the second user device  20  over the Internet  22  to the website  34 . The website  34  responds to the user interface request to transmit the user interface  36  over the Internet  22  to the second user device  20  for viewing within the browser. \\\\n       FIG. 5  illustrates the user interface  36  as displayed on the second user device  20  in  FIG. 1B . The user interface  36  includes a plurality of fields for the user of the second user device  20  to enter login details for the second wallet (Wallet B), including a password and a confirmation of the password. After the user has entered a password, the user can access their wallet by selecting the button \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAccess My Wallet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The wallet establishment module  40  in  FIG. 1B  stores the login credentials in association with the second wallet (Wallet B). The login module  38  also logs the second user device  20  into the second wallet (Wallet B). If the user is logged out, the user can be provided with a login page where the user can enter login credentials that are compared with the login details in the second wallet (Wallet B) and then log into the second wallet (Wallet B) following a favorable match between the login credentials and the login details. \\\\n       FIG. 6  shows a view that is displayed on the second user device  20  in  FIG. 1B . The user is already logged into the wallet, as shown in the top right. The user can accept or decline an agreement.  FIG. 7  displays the first page that is displayed to the user following acceptance of the agreement. The page shows the current balance corresponding to the amount of bitcoin at the Bitcoin address (Bitcoin address  4 ) in  FIG. 3 . The user can select various tools down the left margin, including sending or requesting bitcoin, buying or selling bitcoin, account settings and various merchant tools.  FIG. 8  illustrates a view that is displayed to the user if the user selects the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuy/Sell\\xe2\\x80\\x9d link in  FIG. 7 . The user is prompted to add a bank account.  FIGS. 9 through 15  step the user through the entry of bank account details and verification of the bank account. The user can also select a credit card as a backup payment.  FIGS. 16 to 19  step the user through the entry of a credit card number and a billing address, and  FIGS. 20 and 21  step the user through a verification process to verify that the user is in control of the credit card account.  FIGS. 22 and 23  request additional information from the user.  FIG. 23  also allows the user to verify a phone at a phone number and  FIGS. 24 through 27  step the user through a process for verifying their phone and phone number.  FIGS. 28 through 30  illustrate a process for verifying an identity of the user of the second user device  20 . As illustrated in  FIGS. 31 to 33 , the top margin within the account settings allow for additional tools such as referrals ( FIG. 31 ), viewing of Bitcoin addresses ( FIG. 32 ), and integration with an application programmable interface ( FIG. 33 ). \\\\n       FIG. 34  illustrates a process that is initiated by the user to purchase bitcoin from a wallet of the first host computer system  14 . In the present example, the user selects one (1) bitcoin (BTC) to purchase.  FIGS. 35 and 36  step the user through the process of purchasing the bitcoin. Once the bitcoin is purchased, the user can select on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHistory\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tab in the top margin to display a view as shown in  FIG. 37  wherein the transaction is displayed and is marked as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPENDING\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\\\n       FIG. 38  shows an email that is transmitted by the hosted email module  46  in  FIG. 1B  to the second user device  20  to confirm the purchase of the bitcoin following selection of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cConfirm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d button in  FIG. 35 . The email also has a link that, when selected by the user, opens the browser on the second user device  20  and allows the user to login to their wallet and view the transaction. \\\\n       FIG. 39  shows an email that is transmitted by the hosted email module  46  in  FIG. 1B  to the second user device  20  with a notification that bitcoin has been added to their wallet as part of a referral bonus system. \\\\n       FIG. 40  illustrates a view that is displayed when the user selects a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLimits and Verifications\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tab in the top margin of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuy/Sell\\xe2\\x80\\x9d page. \\\\n     When the user selects the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSend/Request\\xe2\\x80\\x9d link in the left margin in  FIG. 40 , the user is provided an option to send bitcoin from their wallet (Wallet B) in  FIG. 3  to another wallet (e.g. the first wallet (Wallet A)) in  FIG. 3 . \\\\n       FIG. 41  illustrates further transfers or purchases (Transfer  4 ; Transfer  5 ; Transfer  6 ). The fourth transfer (Transfer  4 ) represents the purchase of bitcoin from the first host computer system&#39;s  14  master wallet. \\\\n     The fifth transfer (Transfer  5 ) represents the transfer of bitcoin from the second wallet (Wallet B) to the first wallet (Wallet A). The second wallet (Wallet B) now has login details stored therein. If the second user device  20  in  FIG. 1B  has been logged out of the second wallet (Wallet B), then the second user device  20  is first directed to the login module  38  which receives login details for the second wallet (Wallet B) from the second user device  20 , verifies whether the login credentials for the second wallet (Wallet B) match the login details for the second wallet (Wallet B). If the login details match the login credentials, then the login module  38  logs the second user device  20  into the second wallet (Wallet B). \\\\n     The login module  38  then provides the second user device  20  with access to the hosted email module  46 . The user of the second user device  20  then enters the email address (email address A) of the user of the first wallet (Wallet A) and an amount of bitcoin that the user of the second user device  20  wishes to transfer from the second wallet (Wallet B) to the first wallet (Wallet A). The user of the second user device  20  then uses the hosted email module  46  to send an email via the Internet  22  to the first user device  18 . As soon as the email is sent, a transfer (Transfer  5 ) is recorded within the second wallet (Wallet B). Because one of the Bitcoin addresses (Bitcoin address  4 ) has funds associated therewith, it can be charged for the transfer (Transfer  4 ). Within the second wallet (Wallet B) the transfer (Transfer  4 ) has the email address (email address A) to which the email has been sent and the amount in bitcoin associated therewith. \\\\n     As indicated, the miner&#39;s fee that is paid by the first host computer system  14  and the host fee that is charged for the transfer are zero bitcoin because the first wallet (Wallet A) is stored within the wallets  42  of the first host computer system  14 . The user of the first user device  18  receives the email indicating the transfer of bitcoin to their wallet (Wallet A). A Bitcoin address (Bitcoin address  5 ) is recorded within the first wallet (Wallet A) for the transfer (Transfer  5 ) together with the identifier of the second wallet (Wallet B) from which the transfer has been made and the amount in bitcoin. The amount in bitcoin corresponding to the transfer (Transfer  4 ) in the second wallet (Wallet B) is the same as the amount in bitcoin as in the first wallet (Wallet A). \\\\n     As illustrated by the next transfer (Transfer  6 ), the user of the second wallet (Wallet B) can opt to send bitcoin to a Bitcoin address of the first wallet (Wallet A). The transfer (Transfer  6 ) is the same as the preceding transfer (Transfer  5 ) in all other respects. \\\\n       FIG. 42  shows a view that is displayed to the user of the second user device  20  in  FIG. 1B  in order to make the transfer from their wallet (Wallet B) to the first wallet (Wallet A). The view includes a field for the user to enter the email address (email address A) and fields for entering either an amount in bitcoin (BTC) or an amount in a local currency (USD\\xe2\\x80\\x94United States Dollar). The exchange rate between bitcoin and the local currency is shown in the top left corner. The view also includes a button \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSend Money\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which, when selected by the user, initiates the transfer of bitcoin. \\\\n       FIG. 43  is a view that is displayed to the user indicating transactions that have been initiated or completed. The purchase of bitcoin discussed with reference to  FIGS. 35 to 37  is shown as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPENDING\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. A block chain verification notice has to be broadcast by the miner computer system  28  and be received by the first host computer system  14  in  FIG. 1A  before a determination is made to change the marker \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPENDING\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCOMPLETE\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The other transactions representing transfers between the first and second wallets (Wallet A and Wallet B) in  FIG. 41  are shown as completed because they do not need block chain verification outside of the first host computer system  14 . No block chain verification notice is thus required for these transactions to be marked \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCOMPLETE\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  FIG. 44  shows a view that can be selected by the user by selecting a tab in the top margin wherein the user is shown the Bitcoin addresses associated with transactions that have been completed. \\\\n       FIG. 45  illustrates a further transaction (Transfer  7 ) wherein bitcoin is transferred from the second wallet (Wallet B) to a third wallet (Wallet C) held by the second host computer system  16  in  FIG. 1A . The user of the second user device  20  enters a bitcoin address (Bitcoin address  6 ) that is located in the third wallet (Wallet C) and an amount of bitcoin to be transferred to the third wallet (Wallet C). A transfer (Transfer  7 ) is recorded within the second wallet (Wallet B). Associated with the transfer (Transfer  7 ) are the Bitcoin address (Bitcoin address  6 ), the amount in bitcoin that is being transferred and a miner&#39;s fee that is charged for the transfer and has to be paid by the first host computer system  14  to the miner computer system  28  in  FIG. 1A . No fee is charged by the first host computer system  14  for a transfer to another Bitcoin address. \\\\n     When the user of the second user device  20  in  FIG. 1A  completes the purchase, a transfer instruction is created and is broadcast via the host node  30  to all remote nodes  32 A-D within the Bitcoin network  12 . The transfer instruction thus traverses the first node and the second remote node  32 B to reach the second host computer system  16 . The second host computer system  16  and all other computer systems connected to the remote nodes  32 A-D record the transfer (Transfer  7 ) with respect to the Bitcoin addresses (Bitcoin address  4 ; Bitcoin address  6 ). The transfer (Transfer  7 ) has associated therewith the amount in bitcoin. \\\\n     The transfer instruction that results in the transfer (Transfer  5 ) thus results in no miner&#39;s fee being charged to and paid by the first host computer system  14 . No host fee is charged to the second wallet (Wallet B) because the transfer (Transfer  7 ) is made to another wallet (Wallet A) within the wallets  42  of the first host computer system  14 . By contrast, the transfer instruction that results in the transfer (Transfer  7 ) representing the transfer to the Bitcoin address (Bitcoin address  6 ) in the third wallet (Wallet C) results in a miner&#39;s fee that is paid by the first host computer system  14  to the miner computer system  28 . The miner computer system  28  is responsible for verifying transfers of bitcoin over the Bitcoin network  12 . In the present scenario, the miner computer system  28  verifies the transfer of bitcoin from the second wallet (Wallet B) to the third wallet (Wallet C). \\\\n     Another transfer may comprise that bitcoin is sent to one of the nodes, e.g. node  32 C. The node  32 C could be a fourth user device which is owned by the recipient of the bitcoin transfer having its own bitcoin address. \\\\n       FIG. 46  illustrates components that are used for cold storage of value of bitcoin, including a local storage  56 , a local controller  58 , a vault  64 , a splitter  66 , one or more encryption algorithms  68  and  70  and an offline distribution module  72 . \\\\n     The vault  64  has a Bitcoin address  80  with a private key  79 . The private key  79  is, for purposes of illustration, shown as a nine digit sequence of characters that are provided to the splitter  66 . For purposes of illustration, the splitter  66  splits the nine digits of the private key  79  into seven overlapping codes (Codes  1  to  7 ). The encryption algorithm  68  encrypts the first code (Code  1 ) into an encrypted code (Encrypted Code  1 ). In a similar manner, the second code (Code  2 ) is encrypted by an encryption algorithm (not shown) into an encrypted code (Encrypted Code  2 ). Each one of the seven codes is encrypted into a separate encrypted code. A separate key may be used for each one of seven codes. Alternatively, a separate encryption algorithm may be used for each one of the seven codes. \\\\n     Once all the codes have been encrypted, the offline distribution module  72  transmits each one of the encrypted codes (Encrypted Code  1  to  7 ) to a separate location. The locations are remote locations that are geographically separated from one another. The offline distribution module  72  may also be used to print one or more of the encrypted codes for paper delivery to respective remote locations. \\\\n       FIG. 47  illustrates functioning of the offline distribution module  72  following distribution of the encrypted codes in  FIG. 46 . The offline distribution module  72  removes the private keys  79  of the Bitcoin address  80  of the vault  64 . The offline distribution module  72  also removes the private key  79  of the Bitcoin address  80  within the local storage  56 . \\\\n     As shown in  FIG. 48 , a local register  60  includes a plurality of wallets  42 , one of which is shown. The wallet  42  has a plurality of Bitcoin addresses  74 ,  76  and  78  associated therewith. Each Bitcoin address  74 ,  76  and  78  has a respective value and a respective private key. The local controller  58  transfers the entire value of the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  into the vault  64 . The value relating to the Bitcoin address  74  is not transferred into the vault  64 . The local controller  58  calculates the total value of the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  that have been transferred into the vault  64  and records the total value in the local storage  56  in association with the Bitcoin address  80 . \\\\n     As shown in  FIG. 49 , following removal of the value of the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  within the wallet  42 , the value of the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  are only held within the vault  64  and the local storage  56 . The private key  79  is only held in a split and encrypted form at the distributed locations where the offline distribution module  72  in  FIG. 46  has distributed them to. Unless access can be gained to the private key  79  that has now been split and distributed, it is not possible to access the value of the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78 . It is now possible for a user to which the wallet  42  is registered to use the Bitcoin address  74  for transacting with another user via the wallet management module  44  in  FIG. 1B . The Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  are not usable by the wallet management module  44  for purposes of transacting with another user at this time because their values, within the wallet  42 , have been removed. \\\\n       FIG. 50  shows how the private keys of the vault  64  and the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  that were removed in  FIG. 46  are restored. Components that are provided for restoration include a plurality of restoration interfaces  82 ,  84  and  86 , one or more decryption algorithms  88 ,  90  and  92  and an assembler  94 . The holder of the first encrypted code (Encrypted Code  1 ) is called upon to enter the encrypted code into the restoration interface  82 . The restoration interface  82  may for example be a web page with a field for entry of the first encrypted code. Alternatively, the restoration interface  82  may be an application programmable interface (API) and the first encrypted code can be entered into the API with or without human involvement. \\\\n     In the given example, the second, third, fifth and sixth encrypted codes are not received at this time. The fourth and seventh encrypted codes are received through the restoration interfaces  84  and  86 , similar to the first encrypted code. \\\\n     The decryption algorithm  88  decrypts the first encrypted code (Encrypted Code  1 ) into the first code (Code  1 ). In the given example, the decryption algorithms  90  and  92  decrypt the fourth and seventh encrypted codes (Encrypted Code  4  and Encrypted Code  7 ) into the fourth and seventh codes (Code  4  and Code  7 ) respectively. In the given example, three codes are the minimum number of codes that are required in order to reassemble the private key  79 . The minimum number of codes required for reassembly in  FIG. 48  is thus less than the total number of codes into which the private key  79  has been split in  FIG. 46 . The assembler  94  assembles the private key  79  when the minimum number of codes has been received. \\\\n     The private key  79  of the Bitcoin address  80  in the local storage  56  is used to access the vault  64 . The local controller  58  then restores the private key  79  from the local storage into the vault for association with the Bitcoin address. The block chain will know whether the private key  79  that has been restored is the same private key  79  that was previously associated with the Bitcoin address. Only upon confirmation from the block chain will it be possible to transfer the value from the vault  64  to the local register  60 . \\\\n     The local controller  58  restores the respective value of the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  in the vault  64  to the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  in the wallet  42 . Because the values have been restored to the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  in the wallet  42  they are usable for transacting with other users. \\\\n       FIGS. 51   a  to  51   d  illustrate the use of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9chot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wallet in combination with \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccold storage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. As shown in  FIG. 51   a , the wallet  42  has the Bitcoin addresses  74 ,  76 ,  78  and a further Bitcoin address  98 , each having a respective value associated therewith. The local storage  56  has first, second and third Bitcoin addresses  80 A to  80 C for first, second and third vaults  64 A to  64 C, respectively. The Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  form a first transfer set that is selected for cold storage. The Bitcoin addresses  74  and  98  form a first transacting set. The values of the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  of the first transfer set are transferred into the first vault  64 A, as represented by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cValue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the first vault  64 A. \\\\n     The private key of the Bitcoin address  80 A of the first vault  64 A is then transferred into the local storage  56  and is stored in association with the first Bitcoin address  80 A. As hereinbefore described with reference to  FIG. 46 , the private key of the Bitcoin address  80 A in the local storage  56  is then split and distributed. As hereinbefore described with reference to  FIGS. 47 and 48 , the private keys of the Bitcoin address  80  and the value of the Bitcoin address  76  and  78  are then removed. It is then not possible for a user of the wallet  42  to use the Bitcoin address  76  and  78  for transacting with another user. The user can still transact with another user using the Bitcoin addresses  74  and  98  of the first transacting set because their values are still associated with them within the wallet  42 . \\\\n       FIG. 51   b  shows the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  within the wallet  42  with their values removed and the Bitcoin address  80 A within the local storage  56  with its private key removed. The private key of the Bitcoin address  80 B of second vault  64 B is transferred into the local storage  56  and associated with the second Bitcoin address  80 B within the local storage  56 . The private key of the second Bitcoin address  80 B in the local storage  56  is split and distributed and then removed from the local storage  56 . The Bitcoin address  98  is selected as part of a second transfer set of one or more Bitcoin addresses. The value of the Bitcoin address  98  is transferred from the wallet  42  into the second vault  64 B, as represented by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cValue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the second vault  64 B. The value of the Bitcoin address  98  within the wallet  42  is thus removed. The user of the wallet  42  can now not use the Bitcoin address  98  for purposes of transacting with another user because the value of the Bitcoin address  98  has been removed from the wallet  42 . The Bitcoin address  74  forms part of a second transacting set that may include one or more Bitcoin addresses that can be used for transacting with another user. \\\\n       FIG. 51   c  shows the Bitcoin address  98  having its value removed and the second Bitcoin address  80 B within the local storage  56  having its private key removed. At this stage it may be desirable to restore the values of the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78 . The private key of the first Bitcoin address  80 A within the local storage  56  is restored to the vault  64  as hereinbefore described with reference to  FIG. 50 . The respective values of the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  are then restored from the vault  64 A to the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  in the wallet  42 . Because the values of the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  are restored within the wallet  42 , the Bitcoin addresses  76  and  78  of the first transfer set can, at least for the time being, be used together with the second transacting set for transacting with another user. \\\\n     The same Bitcoin addresses  74 ,  76 ,  78  and  98  that are shown in  FIG. 51   a  are also shown in  FIGS. 51   b  and  51   c . It should be understood that the Bitcoin addresses may change between the figures. The system allows for the value that was previously associated with one Bitcoin address to be restored to another Bitcoin address if necessary. \\\\n     As shown in  FIG. 51   d , the first vault  64 A is discarded after the value therein is restored. The first Bitcoin address  80 A within the local storage  56  and the first vault  64 A will never be used again. \\\\n     The Bitcoin address  78  is selected as a third transfer set. The private key of the Bitcoin address  80 C of the third vault  64 C is transferred into the local storage  56  and stored in association with a third Bitcoin address  80 C. The value of the Bitcoin address  78  is transferred from the wallet  42  to the third vault  64 C. The user of the wallet  42  can now not use the Bitcoin address  78  for transacting with another user. The Bitcoin address  76  forms part of a third transacting set that could include one or more Bitcoin addresses. The Bitcoin address  76  can be used by the user of the wallet  42  for transacting with another user because the value of the Bitcoin address  76  is associated therewith within the wallet  42 . The second and third transacting sets can thus be used by the user for transacting with another user. The second and third transfer sets are unusable for transacting with another user because their private keys have been removed. \\\\n       FIG. 52  illustrates how the local controller  58  (see  FIGS. 46 to 50 ) maintains transaction sets of a wallet  42  within a target range  101 . Should all the Bitcoin addresses of the wallet  42  have values associated therewith, the wallet  42  is said to be 100% hot and 0% cold. If all the Bitcoin addresses in a wallet  42  have their values removed, the wallet  42  is to be 0% hot and 100% cold. The target range  101  for the total bitcoin value within the wallet may for example be 5% to 10% hot. At  102 , the values of the first transacting set are transferred from the wallet  42  as described with reference to  FIG. 51   a . At  104 , the user transacts with some of the Bitcoin addresses and the total value within the wallet  42  of the Bitcoin addresses that are hot is reduced. At  106 , the values of the second transfer set are removed from the wallet  42  as described with reference to  FIG. 51   b . At  108 , the values of the first transfer set are restored as described with reference to  FIG. 51   c . At  110 , the user transacts and gains further Bitcoin addresses for additional value within their wallet  42 . At  112 , values of the third transfer set are transferred out of the wallet  42  as described with reference to  FIG. 51   d . It can thus be seen that the local controller  58  in  FIGS. 46 to 50  adjusts the total value of bitcoin that is not within the target range  101 . The local controller  58  typically recalculates the hot/cold value ratio of each wallet on a daily basis and automatically adjusts the value to the target range  101 . \\\\n       FIG. 53  illustrates the use of an intermediate hot wallet  114  that is used to collect bitcoin values from a plurality of wallets  42 A to C. The wallet  42 A is that same as the wallet  42  as described above. The wallet  42 B has bitcoin addresses  120 ,  122 ,  124  and  126  associated therewith. The wallet  42 C has bitcoin addresses  128 ,  130 ,  132  and  134  associated therewith. Each wallet  42 A, B or C is held within the target range  101  in  FIG. 50 . The values of the bitcoin addresses  76 ,  78 ,  120 ,  122 ,  128  and  130  are identified for transfer to the vault  64 A and are first transferred or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cswept\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the intermediate hot wallet  114  from where they are transferred to the vault  64 A. \\\\n       FIG. 54  illustrates a network environment  136  that, in addition to the first host computer system  14 , includes a customer computer system  138  and a merchant computer system  140  that are connected to one another over the Internet  142 . The merchant computer system  140  has an online store  144  and a website  146 . The customer computer system  138  has a browser  148 . A customer at the customer computer system  138  can use the browser  148  to access the website  136  over the Internet  142 . The website  136  is then displayed on the browser  148 . The website  136  allows for the customer to make purchase on the online store  144 . The customer may, for example, purchase real goods, virtual goods or services from the online store  144 . \\\\n     The first host computer system  14  includes an application programmable interface (API)  150 , a reference code generator  152 , a transaction processor  154 , a currency converter  156  and merchant, and customer and host wallets  158 ,  160  and  162 . The wallets  158 ,  160  and  162  may be of the kind as hereinbefore described. \\\\n     As shown in  FIG. 55 , the customer is shown a shopping cart with several payment options, including \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPay with Credit Card\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPay with bitcoin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prior to being displayed the shopping cart, the customer has traveled through the shopping flow of the merchant computer system  140 , has selected one or more items to be purchased and has selected a shopping or checkout cart, which causes the display of the view shown in  FIG. 55 . When the user selects the button \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPay with bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the merchant computer system  140 , at  166 , transmits an API call to the first host computer system  14 . The API call includes a request for payment. The request for payment includes an amount in a currency, in the present example $14.00, an order name (usually a number), order descriptions (usually items in the checkout cart in a single line-item entry separated by commas), and a success uniform resource locator (URL) if desired (a page to which the customer is redirected at checkout if the order completes). \\\\n     When the first host computer system  14  receives the API call at  166 , the reference code generator  152  generates a unique reference code for the specific order. The reference code is thus uniquely generated for each API call. The first host computer system  14  then stores the reference code in its database. At  168 , the first host computer system  14  responds to the API call received at  166  to transmit the reference code to the merchant computer system  140 . The merchant computer system  140  then receives the reference code as reference code  170 . The merchant computer system  140  stores the reference code as reference code  172  within its accounting system  173  and associates the reference code  172  with the particular order shown in the shopping cart. The merchant computer system  140  also creates a URL  174 . The reference code  170  is used as a reference code  176  within the URL  174  when the URL  174  is created. \\\\n     The first host computer system  14  creates a URL  180  that includes a reference code  182 . The reference code  182  and the reference code  176  are the same. \\\\n     The merchant computer system  140  at  178  redirects the browser  148  ( FIG. 54 ) using the URL  174 . The browser is then redirected to the URL  180  of the first host computer system  14 . \\\\n     The URL  180  may, for example, be the URL of a landing page, iFrame or modal window  184 . The landing page, iFrame or modal window  184  presents checkout options to the customer, including to pay with the customer wallet  160  if one exists, to pay with bitcoin using an external account, or to create a wallet at the first host computer system  14  for purposes of completing the purchase. In a different embodiment, instead of being automatically redirected by the merchant computer system  140  to the first computer system  14 , the customer may be redirected to a different page at the merchant computer system  140 , which will then contain a link for the customer to navigate to the landing page, iFrame or modal window  184 . \\\\n     When the browser  148  of the customer computer system  138  downloads the landing page, iFrame or modal window  184 , the first host computer system  14  automatically generates a bitcoin address  186  specifically for the customer&#39;s order within the merchant wallet  158 . \\\\n     The first host computer system  14  also creates a bitcoin price based on the price in local currency and displays the bitcoin price within the landing page/iFrame or modal window  184  within the browser  148 . The graph illustrates a fluctuating bitcoin to dollar exchange rate. In the present example, the exchange rate at minute 0 is used at  190  to calculate the exchange rate. The local currency price in the present example is $14.00 which gives a bitcoin price of 0.02 BTC. The price of 0.02 BTC that is based on the exchange rate at minute 0 is maintained for a select period of time, in the present example 10 minutes, before it resets. The customer may not wish to immediately send the bitcoin, but may do so at any time before the price resets at minute 10 and the exchange rate remains locked in and the bitcoin price thus remains unchanged at 0.02 BTC during that time. \\\\n     An option is displayed to the customer to send the bitcoin together with the price in bitcoin at minute 0. When the customer selects the option to send the bitcoin, the customer computer system  138  transmits a send instruction to the first host computer system  14 . The first host computer system  14  receives and at  192  detects the send instruction. The customer may for example request to send bitcoin from the customer wallet  160  or via another path as hereinbefore described. The first host computer system  14  responds to the send instruction to transmit an order status message that includes the reference code for the transaction to the merchant computer system  140 . The merchant computer system  140  receives the reference code as reference code  194 . The merchant computer system  140  then matches the reference code  194  to the reference code  172  within its accounting system  173  and marks the transaction as complete. \\\\n     In the present example, the send instruction is processed at minute 6. The exchange rate has in the present example changed between minute 0 and minute 6. Should the bitcoin price of 0.02 BTC be converted to local currency at this time it would result in a different price in local currency than the original transaction. The difference between the original price at minute 0 and minute 6 represents either a loss or a gain for the first host computer system  14 . The loss and gain is used to calculate bitcoin replacement costs on a periodic basis. \\\\n     In the present example the first computer system  14  responds to the send instruction received at  192  to transmit 0.02 BTC to the bitcoin address  186  associated with the merchant wallet  158 . When the bitcoin reaches the bitcoin address  186 , the first host computer system  14 , at  196 , immediately purchases the bitcoin from the merchant wallet  158 , resulting in a transfer of the bitcoin from the merchant wallet  158  to the host wallet  162 . The first host computer system  14  purchases the bitcoin at the exchange rate locked in at minute 0. \\\\n     Periodically, for example daily, the first host computer system  14  calculates the total amount of bitcoin sold by the merchant wallet  158  that day at the locked in prices. The first host computer system  14  has a bank transfer module  200  that, at  202 , transmits a payment instruction to a bank for the first host computer system  14 . The bank for the first host computer system  14  communicates with a bank of the merchant computer system  140 . Such communication, at  204 , results in transfer of funds from a host bank account  206  to a merchant bank account  208 . \\\\n     In the present example, the customer uses their customer wallet  160  to transfer funds in the form of bitcoin from the customer wallet  160  to the merchant wallet  158  and the funds are then transferred in the form of bitcoin from the merchant wallet  158  to the host wallet  162 . In another embodiment, the merchant wallet  158  can be bypassed such that the customer transfers funds in the form of bitcoin from the customer wallet  160  directly into the host wallet  162 . In either embodiment the funds that are received by the host wallet  162  are used as a basis for calculating the amount of money in local currency that is transferred by the bank transfer module  200 , minus a fee that is held back by the first host computer system  14  for purposes of processing the transaction. \\\\n     Referring again to  FIG. 54 , the API  150  sends and receives API calls at  166 ,  168  and the order status message in response to the send instruction  192  in  FIG. 55 . The currency converter  156  is responsible for receiving and maintaining exchange rate for bitcoin to local currency and for calculating the bitcoin price based on the local currency price and the exchange rate at any particular moment in time. The transaction processor  154  is responsible for transferring funds in the form of bitcoin or local currency from one wallet or bank account to another. \\\\n     In the embodiment above, the exchange rate is locked in when the customer accesses the landing page, iFrame or modal window  184  and is locked for ten minutes. In such an embodiment the merchants typically create a payment \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbutton\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or using the API, specifically the button API, of the first host computer system. Selection of the button by the customer results from the process described above wherein the customer is directed to the landing page, iFrame or modal window  184 . Such a button does not need to look any different from the merchant&#39;s standard \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubmit order\\xe2\\x80\\x9d button and the button API is linked into the standard \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubmit order\\xe2\\x80\\x9d button of the merchant computer system  140 , which when clicked will direct the user directly to the landing page, iFrame or modal window  184 . When the user hits the landing page the exchange rate is locked. The merchant \\xe2\\x80\\x9corder\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is thus not created\\xe2\\x80\\x94i.e., with locked in exchange rate\\xe2\\x80\\x94until the user clicks the payment button to land on our landing page. \\\\n     Another embodiment is used in white-label solutions. In these instances, the user is not directed away from the merchant domain to a landing page such as the landing page, frame or modal window  184  to complete payment. Instead, the checkout information that would have otherwise shown on the landing page is displayed inside the merchant&#39;s browser checkout tool. Such an embodiment may not allow \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone-click\\xe2\\x80\\x9d checkout for users who are already signed into their customer wallet  160 ; a user can only pay by QR code scan and/or manual entry of a bitcoin address. In order for this information to be incorporated into the merchant&#39;s webpage, the merchant (1) creates a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbutton\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when they post an item for sale to the website (the button includes the price in local currency, but not a bitcoin price and can be created at any time\\xe2\\x80\\x94e.g., weeks before a purchase); and (2) when the customer wishes to pay, e.g., by clicking on a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlace Order\\xe2\\x80\\x9d button, the merchant computer system  140  sends an API call to the first host computer system  14  which responds by sending back a locked in exchange rate, which again is good for ten minutes. The merchant then displays the checkout information to the user\\xe2\\x80\\x94i.e., the proper bitcoin address and amount. This embodiment differs in that: (1) the \\xe2\\x80\\x9corder\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is created earlier in time, and the exchange rate follows on as a separate API call; and (2) the checkout information is hosted within the merchant&#39;s domain. \\\\n       FIG. 56  illustrates a method of managing bitcoin wherein a personal vault is created for a user. At  220 , the user already has an account that the user can log into using a website. The account has a first email (electronic communication) address. The first email address may be john.smith@gmail.com. The account also has a phone number associated therewith and one or more wallets as herein before described. The website provides the user with a link to create a vault. At  222 , the user is provided an option to create an individual vault or a group vault. In an individual vault the user will be required to respond to two emails in order to transfer bitcoin out of the vault. In a group vault multiple users are required to respond to emails in order for the user of the account represented at  220  to transfer the bitcoin out of the vault. \\\\n     The user may, at  224 , select an individual vault. At  226 , an interface of the website is presented with a field for the user to enter a second email address. The second email address may for example be john.smith@hotmail.com. The user enters the second email address and selects a button to transmit the second email address from their device to the first host computer system  14 . When the first host computer system  14  receives the second email address, the first host computer system  14 , at  228 , transmits a confirmation email with a confirmation link to the second email address. The purpose of the email that is transmitted at  228  is to confirm the second email address. At  230 , the first host computer system  14  waits for the confirmation. The first host computer system  14  does not proceed to create a vault if the confirmation is not received. At  232 , the user selects the confirmation link, which causes transmission of the confirmation from the device of the user to the first host computer system  14 . When the first host computer system  14  receives the confirmation, the first host computer system  14  proceeds at  232  to register a vault within the same account shown at  220 . The vault includes the first and second email addresses. The vault also includes the phone number of the account. \\\\n     At  236 , the first host computer system  14  updates the interface of the website to provide a summary. The summary indicates that, in order to transfer bitcoin out of the vault, emails will be sent to the first and second email addresses, and the summary includes the phone number associated with the vault and that the bitcoin will not be transferred out of the vault for a period of 48 hours. The interface also includes a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFinish\\xe2\\x80\\x9d button. When the user selects the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFinish\\xe2\\x80\\x9d button, the browser used by the user, at  238 , lands in the vault. The vault looks like a wallet, but has a security feature that limits transfer of bitcoin out of the vault. \\\\n     The user may, at  240 , select a group vault. At  242 , the first host computer system  14  provides the user with an option whether 2 out of 3 confirmations are required or 3 out of 5 confirmations are required. If the user selects that 2 out of 3 confirmations are required, then the user is required to enter two email addresses in addition to their own email address shown in the account at  220 . If the user selects that 3 out of 5 confirmations are required, then the user is required to enter four email addresses in addition to their email address shown in the account at  220 . \\\\n     At  224 , the interface of the website is updated to request the additional email addresses from the user. The interface typically includes fields for the user to enter the additional email addresses. \\\\n     At  246 , the first host computer system  14  makes a determination whether all the additional email addresses are associated with other accounts within the first host computer system  14 . If all the additional email addresses are associated with other accounts, then the first host computer system  14  proceeds at  248  to update the account represented at  220  with a vault that includes the first email address, the additional email addresses and the phone number associated therewith. \\\\n     If one or more of the additional email addresses are not associated with any accounts within the first host computer system  14 , then the first host computer system  14 , at  250 , transmits an email to the additional email address that is not associated with an account to create an account. A user receiving the email transmitted at  250  can proceed at  252  to create an account with the second email address associated with the account. Only after all the additional email addresses are associated with accounts does the first host computer system  14 , at  248 , proceed to register a vault. \\\\n     The first host computer system  14  then at  254  provides a summary through the interface of the website. The summary shows that in order to transfer bitcoin, emails will be sent to and confirmations will be required from the first email address and the minimum of the additional email addresses. The summary also includes the phone number associated with the vault and states the waiting period before the bitcoin is transferred. The website also includes a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFinish\\xe2\\x80\\x9d button which, when selected by the user at  238 , lands the browser used by the user in the vault. \\\\n       FIG. 57  illustrates how bitcoin is transferred into and out of the vault. At  260 , the user first transfers bitcoin into the vault. The user may transfer the bitcoin from one of their wallets associated with their account into the vault or may transfer the bitcoin into the vault from an external source. The bitcoin is then stored within the vault. \\\\n     At  262 , the user requests a transfer out of the vault using the website. The user includes the amount of bitcoin to be transferred, the reason for the transfer and selects a wallet to which the bitcoin is to be transferred. The user also includes a two-factor code which the user may obtain through a mobile application or via SMS communication with the first host computer system  14 . \\\\n     At  264 , the first host computer system  14  determines whether the two-factor code is correct. If the two-factor code is incorrect, then the first host computer system  14 , at  266 , makes no change to the website interface. \\\\n     If the determination is made at  264  that the two-factor code is correct, then the first host computer system  14  proceeds at  268  to transmit all emails. In the case of an individual vault, emails are sent to the first and second email addresses represented in the account at  234  in  FIG. 56 . In the case of a group vault, then emails are transmitted to the first email address and the additional email addresses represented in the account at  248  in  FIG. 56 . At  270 , the first host computer system  14  updates the transaction list within the website to represent that approval is being awaited. \\\\n     Each one of the emails has a respective link that can be selected by a recipient. At  272 , a user receiving one of the emails reacts to the email by clicking on the link. Selection of the link causes an authorization instruction to be transmitted from a device of the respective user to the first host computer system  14 . At  274 , the first host computer system  14  detects the authorization instruction received in response to one of the emails that have been transmitted. Selection of the link on the email opens a browser on the recipient&#39;s device and displays a message that the authorization has been successfully approved. \\\\n     At  276 , the recipient of a second one of the emails reacts to the email by clicking the link on the second email to send an authorization instruction. At  278 , the first host computer system  14  detects the authorization instruction transmitted at  276  and displays a web page indicating that the authorization has been successfully approved. \\\\n     When all the predetermined approvals have been received, the first host computer system  14  proceeds, at  280 , to update the transaction list to indicate that clearance is being awaited. At  282 , only if the minimum number of approvals are detected, the first host computer system  14  starts a countdown timer and sends an email to the user of the account informing the user that the bitcoin will be transferred after 48 hours. Block  284  represents the transmission of three email reminders to the user during the 48 hour waiting period. Each email includes the time remaining before the 48 hours will have elapsed and the amount of bitcoin that will be transferred out of the vault. Each email also includes a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCancel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d link. The user can select the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCancel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d link, which caused the transmission of a cancel instruction to the first host computer system  14 . The cancel instruction will cancel the transfer of the bitcoin and therefore the request that was transmitted at  262 . \\\\n     At  286 , the first host computer system  14  detects an end of the time period. The first host computer system  14  then transfers the amount of bitcoin out of the vault and in to the destination selected at  262 . The first host computer system  14  also updates the transaction list on the website to indicate that the transaction has been cleared. \\\\n       FIG. 58  illustrates components of the first host computer system  14  that are used for carrying out the method shown in  FIGS. 56 and 57 , including an account  290  of a user, a website  292 , a vault establishment wizard  294 , a vault management module  296  and the transaction processor  154  hereinbefore described. The vault establishment wizard  294  is programmed to execute the establishment of the vault as described with reference to  FIG. 56 . The vault management module  296  is programmed to manage the vault as described with reference to  FIG. 57 . A user accesses the website  292  and downloads an interface so as to interact via the website  292  with the vault establishment wizard  294  and the vault management module  296 . The vault management module  296  provides instructions to the transaction processor  154  to transfer the bitcoin out of the vault. \\\\n       FIG. 59  shows the email that is transmitted at  228  in  FIG. 56 .  FIG. 60  shows an interface of the website  292  in  FIG. 58  when the user requests a transfer out of a vault at  262  in  FIG. 57 .  FIGS. 61 and 62  show the emails that are transmitted at  268  in  FIG. 57 .  FIG. 63  shows the interface of the website after the minimum number of approvals are received and the countdown clock has been started at  282  in  FIG. 57 . \\\\n     Email addresses are used in the exemplary embodiment for electronic communication via email. Another embodiment may make use of other electronic communication addresses such as text messages to phone numbers or messages through social networks. Such messages may include authorization links as described or authorization may be obtained otherwise such as sending a reply message and including \\xe2\\x80\\x9cY\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the reply message. A secondary electronic communication address may be an individual address or a group address. \\\\n       FIG. 64  illustrates the establishment of a user-controlled vault. At  302 , a user at the first user device  18  transmits a request for a user-controlled vault to the first host computer system  14 . At  304 , the first host computer system  14  responds to the request to initiate key generation. \\\\n     At  306 , the first host computer system  14  generates a seed for a master key. At  308 , the first host computer system  14  uses the seed generated at  306  to generate a master key. The master key includes a public key for the master key and a private key for the master key. At  310 , the first host computer system  14  stores the public key for the master key and, at  312 , stores the private key for the master key. The combination of the keys stored at  310  and  312  form a master key set  314 . \\\\n     A generation script  316  initially resides on the first host computer system  14 . At  318 , the first host computer system  14  transmits the generation script  316  to the first user device  18 . The first user device  18  receives the generation script  316 , which is executable on the first user device  18 . \\\\n     At  320 , the generation script  316  generates a seed for a shared key. The generation script  316  includes a key generation algorithm. At  321 , the key generation algorithm uses the seed generated at  320  to generate a shared key. The shared key includes a public key and a private key. \\\\n     The private key for the shared key is shown at  322 . The generation script  316  also includes an interface with a field for a user to enter a password via a keyboard. At  324 , the user enters the password into the interface. The generation script  316  also includes an encryption algorithm. At  326 , the encryption algorithm generates an encrypted seed from the private key shown at  322  and the password entered at  324 . \\\\n     At  328  and  330 , the key generation algorithm and encryption algorithm respectively send the public key of the shared key and the encrypted seed to the first host computer system  14 . At  332 , the first host computer system  14  stores the public key for the shared key and, at  334 , stores the encrypted seed for the shared key. The public key stored at  332  and the encrypted seed  334  can be viewed as a shared key set  336 . Additionally, the private key shown at  322  forms part of the shared key set  336 . The private key shown at  322  is however never transmitted from the first user device  18  to the first host computer system  14 . \\\\n     At  338 , the generation script  316  further generates a seed for a user key. At  340 , the key generation algorithm uses the seed generated at  338  to generate a user key. The user key includes a public key for the user key and a private key for the user key. At  342 , the key generation algorithm transmits only the public key for the user key to the first host computer system  14 . At  344 , the first host computer system  14  stores the public key for the user key. \\\\n     At  346 , the generation script  316  displays the private key for the user key to the user. The user can then store the private key manually on the first user device  18  or write it down for later use. The first user device  18  never transmits the private key displayed at  346  to the first host computer system  14 . The combination of the public key for the user key stored at  344  and the private key for the user key displayed at  346  form a user key set  348 . \\\\n       FIG. 65  illustrates how the user-controlled vault is used by the user. At  360 , the user of the first user device  18  creates and transmits a request to transact using bitcoin of the user-controlled vault. At  362 , the request reaches the transaction processor  154  hereinbefore described. At  364 , the first host computer system  14  creates an authorization for the transaction. \\\\n     The master key set  312 , shared key set  336  and user key set  334  are replicated from  FIG. 64  and the same reference numerals apply. It should however be understood that these keys are stored or displayed in  FIG. 64  and that the stored and displayed keys are not stored but only retrieved and used in  FIG. 65 . \\\\n     At  366 , the first host computer system  14  signs the authorization  364  with the private key for the master key. Such signature then allows for an authorization to transact at  368 . As shown in  370 , two out of three authorizations are required in order to transact and the authorization provided at  368  may form one of the two authorizations. \\\\n     A verification script  372  initially resides on the first host computer system  14 . At  373 , the first host computer system  14  initiates key collection by transmitting the verification script  372  to the first user device  18 . The verification script  372  is executable on the first user device  18 . Both the generation script  316  in  FIG. 64  and the verification script  372  in  FIG. 65  may be in the form of JavaScript\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 that is executable by a browser on the first user device  18 . \\\\n     The encrypted seed stored at  334  on the first host computer system  14  is transmitted together with the verification script  372  and is received at  374  by the first user device  18 . The verification script  372  further includes an interface with a field for entering a password. At  376 , the user enters the same password that the user entered at  324  in  FIG. 64  into the field provided in the interface using a keyboard. The verification script  372  further includes a decryption algorithm. At  378 , the decryption algorithm uses the encrypted seed and the password to decrypt the encrypted seed and obtain the private key. The encryption at  326  in  FIG. 64  and decryption at  378  in  FIG. 65  may follow the BIP38 protocol which is commonly understood by those skilled in the art of bitcoin encryption. \\\\n     The authorization  364  is transmitted together with the verification script  372  to the first user device  18 . The verification script  372  further has a signature algorithm. At  380 , the signature algorithm signs the authorization with the private key. The signature algorithm then transmits the signed authorization (together with the signature) to the first host computer system  14 . \\\\n     The first host computer system  14  has a verification module. As will be commonly understood as those skilled in the art, a verification module is an algorithm that verifies a signature that was created with a private key using a public key. At  382 , the verification module verifies the signature using the same public key stored at  332  for the shared key in the shared key set  336  that also includes the encrypted seed stored at  334 . At  384 , the verification module determines whether the signature is correct. If the signature is not correct, then the first computer system  14  returns to  374  where the encrypted key is received and the user enters a password. If, at  384 , a determination is made that the signature is correct, then the first host computer system  14  proceeds to  386  to provide an authorization due to the signature being correct. The authorization at  386  may be one of the authorizations required at  370  in order to authorize the transaction. \\\\n     The verification script  372  further includes an interface for entering the private key of the user key that was previously displayed at  346  to the user. At  390 , the user enters the private key into the field provided therefor. At  392 , a signature algorithm forming part of the verification script  372  signs the authorization with the private key that has been entered by the user. The signature algorithm then transmits the signed authorization (together with the signature) to the first host computer system  14 . At  394 , a verification module verifies the signature using the public key that was stored at  344 . At  396 , the verification module determines whether the signature is correct. If the signature is incorrect, then the first host computer system  14  instructs the verification script  372  to return to  390  where the user is again asked for the private key for the user key. If the signature is correct, then the first host computer system  14  proceeds to  398  to provide an authorization for the transaction due to the signature being correct. The authorization provided at  398  may be one of the authorizations required at  370 . \\\\n     What should be noted this time is that the password entered at  376  is never transmitted to the first host computer system  14 . Similarly, the private key entered at  390  is never transmitted to the first host computer system  14 . The user&#39;s control over the password and private key effectively disallows the transaction from being processed outside of the user&#39;s control. \\\\n     After two out of the three authorizations have been received at  370 , the first host computer system  14  proceeds at  400  to authorize the transaction with the transaction processor  154 . \\\\n       FIG. 66  illustrates an address generator  402  that is used to generate addresses such as the bitcoin address that are used for the transaction requested at  360  in  FIG. 65 . A master key seed  404 , shared key seed  406  and user key seed  408  are generated. The master key seed  404  is used to generate a master public key  410  and a master private key  412 . The shared key seed  406  is used to generate a shared public key  414  and a shared private key  416 . The user key seed  408  is used to generate a user public key  418  and user private key  420 . \\\\n     Each one of the keys  410  to  420  may be used to generate child keys M/0, M/1 . . . The shared keys at each level may then be combined to generate an address. For example, the M/0 keys of the master public key  410 , shared public key  414  and user public key  418  may be used to generate an address (Address  0 ). The M/O level may for example be the public keys stored at  310 ,  332  and  334  in  FIG. 64 . The address (Address  0 ) may for example be the bitcoin address for the transaction. Similarly, the M/1 level keys of the master public key  410 , shared public key  414  and user public key  418  may be used to generate another address (Address  1 ). The further addresses may be generated to create further bitcoin addresses of for other purposes. \\\\n       FIG. 67  of the accompanying drawings illustrates the first host computer system  14 , a partner computer system  422  and a receiver computer system  424 . The receiver computer system  424  includes a receiver browser  426 . The partner computer system  422  has a website, in the present example a blog with a blog post  428  that has a blog post URL  430 . At  432 , a user of the receiver computer system  424  uses the receiver browser  426  to create the blog post  428 . \\\\n     The first host computer system  14  has a wallet in the form of receiver account  434 , an embedded code generator and a button ID generator  438 . At  440 , the user of the receiver computer system  424  creates the receiver account  434 . The receiver account  434  has login details  442  and a receiver account identifier (ID)  444 . At  446 , the user of the receiver computer system  424  logs into the receiver account  434  and enters the blog post URL  430  through the user interface  36  ( FIG. 1B ). The blog post URL  430  is then stored in association with the particular receiver account  434  with the wallet management module  44  ( FIG. 1B ). At  448 , the first host computer system  14  provides the blog post URL  430  to the embedded code generator and button ID generator  438 . The embedded code generator  438  then generates an embedded code  450  and, at  452 , transmits the embedded code  450  to the receiver browser  426 . The embedded code  450  includes the blog post URL  430 , receiver account ID  444  and a startup caller  454 . \\\\n     The blog post  428  on the partner computer system  422  has a frame for pasting the embedded code  450  due to prior agreement between operators of the first host computer system  14  and the partner computer system  422 . At  456 , the user of the receiver computer system  424  copies the embedded code  450  received at  452  and pastes the embedded code  450  into the frame of the blog post  428 . The embedded code  450  is then embedded and forms part of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) of the blog post  428 . \\\\n     A blog post  428  is used herein to describe the invention by way of example. It should however be understood that the invention may have broader application. A URL of a page may for example have a video, song or news article. Such a page will typically have a frame for pasting the embedded code  450 . Alternatively, media content such as a video may not have a separate frame for pasting the embedded code. Instead, another manner of activating payment features of the invention may be provided, such as a separate URL link, voice activation, detection of human gestures of a user, etc. \\\\n     The button ID generator (see  438 ) generates a unique button ID. At  458 , the button ID generator stores the button ID as button ID  460  within a data store of the first host computer system  14 . At  462 , the button ID generator  438  stores the button ID  460  in association with the particular receiver account ID  444  and particular blog post URL  430 . Multiple receiver accounts may exist within the first host computer system  14 . In addition, a receiver account may have multiple blog post URL&#39;s associated therewith. Each pair of a respective receiver account ID and respective blog post URL have a unique button ID. \\\\n       FIG. 68  shows the first host computer system  14 , the partner computer system  422  and a sender computer system  464 . The sender computer system  464  has a sender browser (not shown). At  466 , the sender browser downloads the blog post  428  from the partner computer system  422 . The startup caller  454  is a script, e.g. JavaScript\\xc2\\xae, that automatically executes on the sender computer system  464 . At  470 , the startup caller  454  retrieves all sender cookies  472  on the sender computer system  464 . The startup caller  454 , at  474 , transmits a startup call to the first host computer system  14 . The startup call includes the cookies  472 , the blog post URL  430  and the receiver account ID  444 . \\\\n     The first host computer system  14  includes a startup call responder  476  that receives the startup call  474 . The startup call responder  476 , at  478 , uses the blog post URL  430  and receiver account ID  444  received in the startup call  474  to identify the particular button ID  460 . \\\\n     The button ID  460  in storage may have bits  480  representing all payments made in association with the button ID  460 . At  482 , the startup call responder  476  retrieves the bits  480  associated with the button ID  460  from the data store. \\\\n     At  483 , the startup call responder  476  transmits a startup call response to the sender computer system  464 . The startup call response transmitted at  483  is in response to the startup call received at  474 . The startup call response includes a button  484 , the bits  480 , a session script  486  and the button ID  460 . A display  490  of the sender computer system  464  displays the blog post  428 . The embedded code  450  has added the button  484  and the bits  480  to the blog post  428 . The button  484  is a two-dimensional button that is selectable by a user of the sender computer system  464 . The session script  486  is associated with the button  484  so as to be executable when the user selects the button  484 . \\\\n     The embedded code  450 , at  491 , stores the button ID  460  within the sender cookies  472 . The button ID  460  stored within the sender cookies  472  can now be used to identify the button ID  460  within the first host computer system  14 . \\\\n     In  FIG. 69 , the user has selected the button  484  which, at  492 , initiates the session script  486 . The session script  486 , at  494 , retrieves the sender cookies  472  and, at  496 , makes a session call to the first host computer system  14 . The session call  496  includes the cookies  472 . \\\\n     The first host computer system  14  includes a session responder  498  that receives the session call  496 . At  500 , the session responder  498  checks all data for the button ID  460  that has been received in the session call  496 . The data associated with the button ID  460  may include a bitcoin address  502 , although no bitcoin address may be included within the cookies  472  of the session call  496 . At  504 , the session responder  498  determines whether a bitcoin address was received in the cookies  472  of the session call  496 . If no bitcoin address was received, the first host computer system  14  executes a bitcoin address generator  506 . The bitcoin address generator  506  then generates a bitcoin address and, at  508 , stores the bitcoin address in association with the button ID  460 . The newly saved bitcoin address is represented as bitcoin address  510 . At  512 , the session responder  498  transmits the bitcoin address  510  that has been generated by the bitcoin address generator  506  to the sender computer system  464 . At  514 , the session script  486  stores the bitcoin address  510  in association with the button ID  460  within the sender cookies  472 . Upon a browser refresh, the process started at  466  in  FIG. 68  is restarted and all cookies are stored from earlier browser sessions are collected and transmitted by the startup caller  454 . \\\\n     At  516 , the session responder  498  determines whether the sender computer system  464  is signed into a sender account. The determination is made based on whether a signed-in cookie is found among the cookies transmitted in the session call  496 . If no signed-in cookie is found, then the session responder  498  proceeds to  518 . At  518 , the session responder  498  sends a sign-in panel  520 , a sign-in script  522 , a listen code  524 , a third party payment script  526 , and a pull code  528  to the sender computer system  464 . The session script  486  creates an overlay window that includes the sign-in panel  520  with a sign-in button  530  having the sign-in script  522  associated therewith. The user can select the sign-in button  530  which, at  532 , initiates the sign-in script  522 . The sign-in script  522  creates and opens a further window (not shown) that allows the sender of the sender computer system  464  to enter login details  534  of a sender account  536 . At  540 , the sign-in script  522  signs the sender computer system  464  into the sender account  536  using the login details  534 . The sign-in script  522 , at  548 , stores a signed-in cookie  549  within the sender cookies  472 . The sign-in panel  520  further includes two payment selections, including a third party wallet button  544 , and a Quick Response (QR) code  546 . The third party payment script  526  is stored in association with the third party wallet button  544 . The listen code  524  and pull code  528  are stored in an executable manner within the sender computer system  464 . The session script  486  retrieves the bitcoin address  510  from the sender cookies  472  and displays the bitcoin address  510  within the sign-in panel  520 . \\\\n     As shown in  FIG. 70 , if the determination at  516  is made that the sender computer system  464  is signed-in to the sender account  436 , or after the sender computer system  464  signs-in at  540  in  FIG. 69 , the session responder  498  proceeds to  550 . At  550 , the session responder  498  transmits a signed-in panel  552 , the listen code  524 , the third party payment script  526 , the pull code  528  and a host account payment script  554  to the sender computer system  464 . The signed-in panel  552  is the same as the sign-in panel  520  with the exception that it includes a host account button  556  instead of the sign-in button  530 . The third party payment script  526  is stored in association with the third party wallet button  544 . The host account payment script  554  is stored in association with host account button  556 . \\\\n     Selection by the user of the host account button  556  initiates at  560  the host account payment script  554 . The host account payment script  554  transmits an instruction to the transaction processor  154  of the selection. At  561 , the transaction processor  154  makes a payment out of the sender account  536  to the receiver account  434  as hereinbefore described without going through the bitcoin network or the block chain. \\\\n     At  564 , the transaction processor  154  updates the bits  480  by adding the bits of the present transaction to the bits  480  already stored within the data store. The bits  480  within the data store thus represent an ongoing tally of all payments made in association with the button ID  460 . The bitcoin addresses  502  and  510  represent bitcoin addresses that are generated for different sender computer systems  464  using the same button ID  460 . \\\\n     After the host account payment script  554  transmits the instruction to the transaction processor  15 , the host account payment script  554  initiates the pull code  528 . The pull code  528 , at  574 , pulls the new bit count from the bits  480  in the storage of the first host computer system  14 . At  566 , the pull code  528  updates the bits  480  in the blog post  428  based on the bits that have been pulled by the pull code  528  in  FIG. 70 . \\\\n     As shown in  FIG. 71 , the user selects the third party wallet button  544  which, at  560 , causes execution of the third party payment script  526 . The third party payment script  526  then transmits a transaction (of bitcoin to the bitcoin address  510 ) to a third party transaction processor  562 . The third party transaction processor  562  is hosted by a host computer system other than the first host computer system  14 . At  564 , the third party transaction processor  562  broadcasts the transaction to the bitcoin network  12  and it is picked up by the blockchain. \\\\n     The first host computer system  14  further includes a block chain checker  567  and a bit updater  568 . The block chain checker  567 , at  570 , periodically checks the block chain. For purposes of this discussion, the block chain checker  567  checks the block chain to determine whether there are any new transactions for the bitcoin addresses  502  and  510  stored in association with the button ID  460 . If the block chain checker  567  finds any further transactions, the block chain checker  567  notifies the bit updater  568 . At  572 , the bit updater  568  updates the bits  480  that are associated with the respective bitcoin address  502  or  510 . The bits  480  are updated by adding bits for any new transactions that have been picked up by the block chain checker  567 . \\\\n     At  574 , the bit updater  568  transmits a push update notification to the sender computer system  464 . The listen code  524  receives the push update notification. Websocket technology may for example be used for the push update notification in order to open an interactive communication link. The listen code  524  is continuously active and therefore continuously listens for push update notifications. When the listen code  524  receives the push update notification, the listen code  524  initiates the pull code  528 . The pull code  528 , at  574 , pulls the new bit count from the bits  480  in storage. At  566 , the pull code  528  updates the bits  480  in the blog post  428  based on the bits that have been pulled by the pull code  528  in  FIG. 70 . \\\\n     The QR code  546  may be scanned by an app on a mobile phone. The bitcoin address  510  is encoded in the QR code  546 . The app can decode the QR code  546  to extract the bitcoin address  510  and transmit a transaction (of bitcoin to the bitcoin address  510 ) to a third party transaction processor such as the third party transaction processor  562 . \\\\n     The button  484  shown in  FIG. 69  can be used as a Tip button. A user of the sender computer system  464  can use the button  484  to make a small discrete payment to the user of the receiver computer system  424 . Such a payment may, for example, be as a reward for the content of the blog post  428 . \\\\n       FIG. 72  shows a system  600  for transacting bitcoin. An Internet interface  602  allows for user computers (user computers A to C) to connect to the system  600  over the Internet. Order gateways  604  are connected to the Internet interface  602  to receive buy and sell offers via the Internet interface  602  from the user computers A to C. A matching engine  606  is connected to the order gateways  604 . The matching engine  606  can receive the buy and sell offers from the order gateways  604 . \\\\n     A feed generator  608  is connected to the Internet interface  602 . The matching engine  606  provides an output to a multicast pipeline  610 . The feed generator  608  is connected to the multicast pipeline  610 . The feed generator  608  receives the buy and sell offers from the multicast pipeline  610  and displays any buy and sell offers via the Internet interface  602  to the user computers A to C. Users can thus view any buy and sell offers already in the system before making their own buy and sell offers. \\\\n     The matching engine  606  can match buy and sell offers and broadcast the matches to the multicast pipeline  610 . The feed generator  608  displays the matches via the Internet interface  602  to the user computers A to C. \\\\n     An exchange database  612  includes records of bitcoin and currency held by users A to C corresponding to the user computers A to C. A clearing module  614  is connected to the multicast pipeline  610  and receives matches from the multicast pipeline  610 . An exchange  616  is connected to the clearing module  614 . The exchange  616  is also connected to the Internet interface  602 . Users at the user computers A to C can provide instructions via the Internet interface  602  to the exchange  616  to transfer bitcoin or currency. The exchange  616  has a number of functions, including calculating total amounts of bitcoin and currency as represented in the exchange database  612 , cross checking bitcoin and currency totals between the exchange database  612  and an exchange user  618 , transferring bitcoin and currency between wallets A to C that correspond respectively to the users A to C in the exchange database  612 , updating bitcoin and currency amounts of the users A to C in the exchange database  612 , and may receive and execute instructions from the clearing module  614  to transfer bitcoin and currency between the users A to C in the exchange database  612 . \\\\n     The exchange is connected to a ledger  620 . The ledger  620  hold records of wallets A to C and further functions to cross-check balances between the exchange database  612  and exchange user  618 . \\\\n       FIG. 73   a  shows the beginning of a transfer-in algorithm that is executed by the system  600 . A user at user computer A has $10 of currency in the exchange database  612 . For purposes of discussion, no other users have any bitcoin or currency. The exchange  616  calculates the total amount of currency and bitcoin within the exchange database  612  and records the total amount as $10 and 0 bitcoin. The exchange user  618  has $10, representing a previous transfer from wallet A to the exchange user  618 . \\\\n     At  1   a , a user at user computer B requests a transfer via the Internet interface  602 . The transfer may for example be to transfer $20 from wallet B to the exchange user  618 . At  1   b , the Internet interface  602  provides the transfer request to the exchange  616 . At  2   a , the exchange  616  sends a cross-check request to the ledger  620  and at  2   b  the ledger  620  cross checks the totals in the exchange database  612  and the exchange user  618  before proceeding with a transfer. In the present example, the exchange database  612  has $10 and 0 bitcoin and the exchange user  618  has $10 and 0 bitcoin. The totals therefore match. If either the currency or bitcoin totals do not match, the exchange  616  does not make any further transfers and provides an alert to an operator. The operator will then remedy any mismatches and then reactivate the exchange  616 . Because the totals match, the exchange  616  proceeds with the transfer. \\\\n     As shown in  FIG. 73   b , the exchange  616 , at  3 , transfers $20 from wallet B to the exchange user  618 . The exchange user  618  calculates the total amount held by the exchange user  618  as $30, representing the $10 that was there before the transfer plus another $20 because of the transfer. \\\\n     At  4   a , the exchange  616  records $20 for user B in the exchange database  612 . At  4   b , the exchange  616  updates the totals and records a total amount of $30, representing the $10 held by user A and the $20 that has been added for user B. \\\\n       FIG. 73   c  illustrates the totals in the exchange database  612  and the exchange user  618  after a further transfer wherein a user at the user computer C has requested a transfer of 5 bitcoin from wallet C to the exchange user  618 . The exchange user  618  now holds 5 bitcoin and $30. User C, within the exchange database  612 , now holds 5 bitcoin. The totals held with the exchange database  612  are $30 and 5 bitcoin. For purposes of discussion, this ends the transfer-in algorithm that was started in  FIG. 73   a.    \\\\n       FIG. 73   d  shows a trading algorithm that is carried out after the transfer-in algorithm if  FIGS. 73   a  to  73   c . At  5   a , a user (buyer) at user computer A submits a buy offer of 2 bitcoin at $5 each ($10 total). As noted previously, all offers are transmitted via the Internet interface  602 , one of the order gateways  604 , the matching engine  606  and the multicast pipeline  610  to the feed generator  608  which displays the offers on the Internet interface  602 . A user at user computer C can thus see the buy offer submitted by the user at user computer A. At  5   b , the user (seller) at user computer C submits a sell offer for 2 bitcoin at $5 each to the Internet interface  602 . At  5   c , the buy and sell offers are submitted by the Internet interface  602  to one of the order gateways  604 . At  5   d , the order gateway  604  provides the buy and sell offers sequentially to the matching engine  606 . \\\\n     As mentioned, the user at user computer C can see the buy offer of the user at user computer A before submitting the sell offer. In another example, the user at user computer C can first submit the sell offer and the sell offer can be seen by the user at user computer A. The buy and sell offers will typically be received by the matching engine  606  at different times. \\\\n     Multiple users may submit one or more buy and sell offers. The matching engine  606  attempts to match the buy and sell offers to one another. At  6 , the matching engine  606  has matched the buy and sell offers received from users at the user computers A and C. \\\\n     The matching engine  606  then provides a broadcast of the match over the multicast pipeline  610  discussed with reference to  FIG. 72 . At  7   a , the feed generator  608  receives a multicast that includes the match. At  7   b , the clearing module  614  receives the same multicast that includes the match. At  8 , the feed generator  608  provides a feed to the Internet interface  602  that includes the match. As previously mentioned, the feed generator  608  also provides a feed of buy and sell offers to the Internet interface  602 . \\\\n     At  9   a , the clearing module  614  updates user A within the exchange database  612  by adding 2 bitcoin and subtracting $10 from user A. At  9   b , the clearing module  614  updates user C by subtracting 2 bitcoin from and adding $10 to user C. The clearing module  614  makes the updates directly to the exchange database  612 . \\\\n     There is no need for recalculating the totals within the exchange database  612  at this stage. The same amount of currency or bitcoin that has been subtracted from one user has been added to another user. The exchange database  612  thus still indicates totals of $30 and 5 bitcoin. \\\\n       FIG. 73   e  shows a withdrawal algorithm that can be carried out after the trading algorithm in  FIG. 73   d . At  10   a , a user at user computer C requests a withdrawal of, for example, $10. The request is received via the Internet interface  602  and is passed on to the exchange  616  at  10   b.    \\\\n     At  11   a , the exchange  616  sends a cross-check request to the ledger  620  and at  11   b  the ledger  620  cross checks the totals before proceeding. In the present example, the amount of bitcoin in the exchange user  618  and the total amount of bitcoin represented in the exchange database  612  are the same and the total currency amount in the exchange user  618  and in the exchange database  612  are the same. Should either of these two comparisons result in a mismatch, the exchange  616  will not make any withdrawal and create an alarm for an operator. \\\\n     As shown in  FIG. 73   f , at  12 , the exchange  616  transfers $10 from the exchange user  618  to the wallet C. The exchange user  618  now has $20, representing the $30 in  FIG. 73   e  minus the $10 that has been transferred out. At  13   a , the exchange  616  adds a representation for user C in the exchange database  612  showing a withdrawal of $10. At  13   b , the exchange  616  updates the totals. Because user C has made a withdrawal of $10, the total currency amount within the exchange database  612  amounts to $20. The amount of bitcoin is still the same. The total amounts in the exchange user  618  and in the exchange database  612  are thus the same. \\\\n     Other users may submit similar withdrawal requests. For example, a user at user computer A may request a withdrawal of 1 bitcoin. The exchange  616  then cross checks the total amounts, makes a transfer of 1 bitcoin from the exchange user  618  to wallet A and updates the exchange database  612  by deducting  1  bitcoin from user A and updates the total amount of bitcoin to  4  bitcoin. \\\\n       FIG. 74  shows a diagrammatic representation of a machine in the exemplary form of a computer system  900  within which a set of instructions, for causing the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein, may be executed. In alternative embodiments, the machine operates as a standalone device or may be connected (e.g., networked) to other machines.
